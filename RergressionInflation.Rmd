## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Coefficient for GDP Growth Rate: 1.676 (p = 0.737), indicating no statistically significant impact on inflation.

R-squared: 0.013, showing that only 1.3% of the inflation variance is explained by GDP growth.

Adjusted R-squared: -0.097, suggesting a poor model fit.

F-statistic: 0.12 (p = 0.737), further confirms the model's insignificance.

The residual analysis shows a pattern and skewed distribution, indicating issues with model assumptions. In summary, GDP growth rate alone is not an effective predictor of inflation in this model.

```{r}

```

```{r}
FedFunds_Data$DATE <- as.Date(FedFunds_Data$DATE)
FedFunds_Data$Year <- year(FedFunds_Data$DATE)
```
```{r}
Annual_FedFunds <- FedFunds_Data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(FedFunds_Rate = mean(FEDFUNDS, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  inner_join(Annual_FedFunds, by = "Year")
```
```{r}
model_with_fedfunds <- lm(Annual_Inflation ~ GDP_Growth_Rate + FedFunds_Rate, data = merged_data)
summary(model_with_fedfunds)
```
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(model_with_fedfunds$residuals, main = "Residuals Plot (with FedFunds)", ylab = "Residuals", xlab = "Index")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")

hist(model_with_fedfunds$residuals, main = "Residuals Histogram (with FedFunds)", xlab = "Residuals", breaks = 10)
```
The model’s R-squared value of 0.6908 indicates that about 69% of the variance in inflation is explained by the model, demonstrating a strong fit. The adjusted R-squared, at 0.6135, confirms that the model remains a good fit even after accounting for the number of predictors. Additionally, the F-statistic of 8.937 with a p-value of 0.009 suggests that the overall model is significant, meaning that at lea the Federal Funds Rate has a meaningful impact on inflation.

In summary, the Federal Funds Rate is a better predictor of inflation than GDP growth rate, as it is statistically significant and improves the model’s explanatory power. Including the Federal Funds Rate in the model greatly enhances its ability to predict inflation, making it a more suitable independent variable for this analysis compared to GDP growth rate alone.
